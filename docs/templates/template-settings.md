# Template Notes
The template notes will be copied to the checklist notes. If you are manually running a template (i.e not via schedule), you can still make changes to the notes beforehand.

To add/ edit notes:
* click on the "Template Notes" placeholder or the existing notes to enter "Edit Mode"
* enter your notes or change the existing notes
* if happy with your changes hit Enter, Tab or click with the mouse anywhere outside the textbox and your changes will be saved
* if unhappy with your changes, hit ESC to discard them

# Sharing
By default, only you have access to the template. If you want to share it with your team, you can do so by toggling the Team Sharing toggle button.

Sharing is on when the toggle is orange (and to the right) and off when grey (and to the left).

#### Checklist View
You can set which views will be available for users of the checklists created. This is similar to the [View Selector](/checklists/checklists/#checklist-view-selector) of the Checklist Page.

#### Propagation
Propagation refers to how parent and child tasks should behave when they are completed. Read more about [task propagation](/checklists/form-view/#propagation). These two setting control the setting of checklists created from this template.
