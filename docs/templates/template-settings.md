To view a template's settings, click on the Gear button on the template page (top right). This will open the Settings dialog where you can mange the following:

## View Type

Set which view type generated checklists will have. Read more about checklist [View Types](/checklists/checklist-views/):

![Template settings type](/assets/images/templates/template-settings-type.png)

Note: If you choose "Checklist" type, your tasks can only have the 'Check' type.

## Notes

The template notes will be copied to the checklist notes when the checklist is triggered. If you are manually triggering a template (i.e not via a schedule), you can still make changes to the notes before triggering.

To add/ edit notes:

- click on the "Click to set Template Notes" placeholder or on the existing notes to enter "Edit Mode"
- enter your notes or change the existing notes
- hit Enter to save your notes
- hit Escapre to discard your changes

Tip: your notes can be on multiple lines.

## Sharing

By default, only you have access to the template. If you want to share it with your team and allow other members with the 'Editor' role to edit this template, toggle the Team Sharing to 'on'.

Sharing is on when the toggle is orange (and to the right) and off when grey (and to the left).

## Propagation

Propagation refers to how parent and child tasks should behave when they are marked as Completed or Open. Read more about [task propagation](/checklists/form-view/#propagation). These two setting are copied to the checklists triggered from the template.

Propagation is on when the toggle is orange (and to the right) and off when grey (and to the left).
