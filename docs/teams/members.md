Invite colleagues, customers, suppliers, friends and family to collaborate with you on getting things done! 

Membership is always within the context of a Team (and not organization). 

Once you have invited a user and they have accepted, you can fine tune their access to team resources by assigning them 1 or more roles (see [#understanding-roles](below)).

## Inviting a Member
To invite someone to be a memebr of a team, navigate to that team and scroll down to the "Invite a member" section:

![](/assets/images/teams/members-invite.png)

Enter the email address of the person you wish to invite and hit the Invite button. We will send an invitation email to that person asking them to confirm. If they do not already have a Checklist account, they will be asked to create one. 

Once confirmed, they will be shown on your 

## Viewing Members
To view your team members, navigate to the Team page and scroll down until you reach the Team Members section:

![](/assets/images/teams/members-view.png)

All team members, including those who are pending will show up in the table. 

If you are a team admin, you are also able to manage the memebrs.

## Removing a Member
Team admins can remove members from the team. There must be at least one ADMIN member left. If an admin wished to remove themselves from the team, and they are the only admin, they must first make another user into an admin.

An organization owner can always act as a team admin.

Non-admin user may remove themselves from the team even if they are not admins. They cannot perform any other member management action.

## Updating Member Roles
To manage the roles of a specific member, navigate to the Team page and scroll down to the Team Members section. On the row of the member you wish to change, click on the existing roles to open the roles dropdown:

![](/assets/images/teams/members-view.png)

Check or an uncheck the roles you wish to change. When ready, click anywhere on the screen (or hit Esc) to close the dropdown.

You must be an admin in order to change member roles. You cannot change the roles of Members who are still pending.

## Understanding Roles
Below is an explanation of each role. Please note that the roles are cummulative. E.g. an editor can edit templates but cannot trigger (run) them unless they also have the runner role.

### Admin
Team admins can:
* manage team name
* manage members (invite, remove, update roles)
* update team timezone

Only organization admins can delete a team.

### Editor
Team editors have read/ write access to the team's templates. They can:
* view all team templates
* create new templates
* edit existing templates (of the team)
* delete a template

### Runner
Team runners are responsible for running (triggering) templates manually. They can
* From team Dashboard page view all team templates which are marked with a star
* From the team Dashboard run any "star"ed template (trigger)
