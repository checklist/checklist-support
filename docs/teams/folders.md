Folders allow you to manage both your templates and checklists. 

Folders are optional. If a checklist or template is not assigned a folder, it will simply be in the sections without a folder. 

Folders are managed from the team page:

![](/assets/images/teams/folders.png)

Only team admins can manage folders but they can be used by anyone in the team.

## Add a Folder
To add a folder, navigate to the team and click on the New Folder button:

![](/assets/images/teams/folders-add.png)

A dialog will open in which you can set a name to the new folder. Click the Create button and the folder wil be added.

Note: a folder name must be 3-30 alphnumeric characters. Spaces are allowed.

## Rename Folder
To rename a folder, simply click on the pencil icon:

![](/assets/images/teams/folders-rename.png)

The Edit Folder Name dialog will open. Make the changes you wish to the folder name and hit Save. 

Note: the same folder name constraints as in adding a folder apply here.

## Reorder Folder
To reorder a folder, simply drag it by the "dragger":

![](/assets/images/teams/folders-reorder.png)

You can drag it up or down. Once you reorder a folder it will apply to the whole team checklists, templates and for all the team users.

## Delete Folder
To delete a folder, click on the trash button and confirm:

![](/assets/images/teams/folders-reorder.png)

Note: any checklists or templates in the deleted folder do NOT get deleted. They are simply moved into the Uncategorized folder below all other folders.
