Folders allow you to manage both your templates and checklists. 

Folders are optional. If a checklist or template is not assigned a folder, it will simply be in the sections without a folder. 

Folders are managed from the team page:

![](/assets/images/teams/folders.png)

Only team admins can manage folders but they can be used by anyone in the team.

## Add a Folder
To add a folder, navigate to the team and click on the New Folder button:

![](/assets/images/teams/folders-add.png)

On the opened dialog, set a name to your new folder and click on Create button. 

Note: a folder name must be 3-30 alphnumeric characters. Spaces are allowed.
