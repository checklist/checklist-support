Each Organization can have one or more teams. This allows you to divide your organization into departments, units etc. If you work alone, you can use your personal team (which was automatically created for you on sign up). A team can have: members, templates, checklists and automations.

For example, a hotel can have the following teams: Front desk, Housekeeping, Maintenance, Marketing & Finance.
