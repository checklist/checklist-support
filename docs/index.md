# Welcome to Checklist

{:toc}

Whether it's a straightforward To-Do list or a sophisticated, repeatable business process, Checklist is your go-to tool for staying organized. Use it individually, with a team, company, or among friends and family. Synchronize your work across devices, integrate checklists with third-party software, and make checklists a part of your life and business.

At the heart of Checklist is, of course, the checklist: a compilation of tasks with optional sub-tasks. Each task has a name and status (open/complete). You can augment it with additional fields like due dates, notes, assignees, or anything else you desire. Unlike other apps, Checklist offers multiple viewing options for your checklists: as a list, in a table, or as a form that needs to be completed and checked.

Your checklists are always in sync across your devices and with anyone else who has access to them. This not only facilitates collaboration but also ensures an automatic backup of your work. You can access your checklists from both desktop and mobile browsers.

Ever heard the phrase, "don't reinvent the wheel"? Most likely, someone else has already thought of the checklist you're about to create. Take advantage of our extensive database of thousands of checklist templates to jumpstart your next checklist. If there's a checklist you anticipate using repeatedly, turn it into a template yourself. You can then share it with your team or the entire Checklist community by publishing it.

Elevate your productivity and enhance your checklists with Automation. Automate repetitive tasks such as triggering daily checklists, automatically assigning tasks, or sending an email when a checklist is completed. You can also integrate with thousands of third-party applications through Checklist.
