# Get Started with Checklist

To get started, you will first need to create a Free Checklist account. Simply head to https://checklist.com/account and sign in (you will be asked to create an account or login if you havn’t done so already). Come back here once you are done.

For the next step, let’s see what you are trying to achieve. We have tried to generalize the different options so that they can fit most use cases. Select your use case to learn more:

# A one time project
Useful when you want to have a one-off list to work off. Typically for a single project (could be ongoing). The tasks can be known in advance or added on the fly.
* I want to have a simple list with tasks I can check off
* I need a checklist where each task can have multiple fields (like notes, assignees, attachments, emails, urls etc.)

# A repetitive process
Checklists are a great tool for working with repetitive business processes. 
* I have a business process that needs to be repeated on schedule 
* I have a business process that needs to be handled on demand by me or one of my team members
* I need to handle information collected by an online form
