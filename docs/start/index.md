# Get Started with Checklist

To begin, you need to create a free Checklist account. Simply visit [My Account ↗](https://checklist.com/account){:target="\_blank"}, and sign in (create an account or log in if you haven't already). Return here once you've completed this step.

For the next phase, let's identify your objectives. We've categorized different options to suit various use cases. Click on your scenario:

# 1) A One-Time project

Ideal for a standalone list related to a single project (could be ongoing). Tasks can be pre-known or added as needed. You can use the following views to manage your list (while easily changing between them as needed):

- [List View](#list-view) - a list with tasks to check off
- [Table View](#table-view) - a checklist in table format, with each task (row) having additional fields (columns)

# 2) A Repetitive Business Process

Checklists are a great tool for managing Repetitive Business Processes:

- [Checklist Template](#checklist-template) - a repetitive process that needs to be handled on-demand by me or one of my team members
- [Scheduled Template](#scheduled-template) - a repetitive process handled on a regular schedule by me or one of my team members
- [Form2Task](#form2task) - collect responses from my customers and have them automatically turned into tasks for further handling by my team

Not sure which fits your case? Read below for more details.

## List View

A checklist with tasks to check off:

![Checklist in list view](/assets/images/start/start-checklist-view.png){: .image-large}

Starts simple but is very powerful! This view also offers: subtasks, notes, attachments, due dates, reminders, sharing, assigning and more.

Example Use cases: [House moving ↗](https://checklist.com/moving-checklist){:target="\_blank"}, [Business statup ↗](https://checklist.com/business-startup-checklist){:target="\_blank"}, [Event ↗](https://checklist.com/event-checklist "Event Checklist"){:target="\_blank"}, [Cleaning](https://checklist.com/cleaning-checklist "Cleaning Checklist"){:target="\_blank"}

Read more on [List View](/checklists/checklist-view) or get started by customizing our [Daily to do ↗](https://checklist.com/daily-to-do-list){:target="\_blank"} template (you can play around with the list and customize it to your needs).

## Table View

This view displays your checklist in a table format:

![Checklist in table view](/assets/images/start/start-table-view.png)

Task can have different fields (in columns) such as notes, assignees, attachments, emails, URLs, etc. You have complete control over the fields you want to add to your table.

Example Use cases: Project Task Tracking and Assigning, Inventory management, Product development, CRM (lead management)

## Checklist Template

If you have a business process (i.e a set of defined tasks) that needs to be repeated on schedule or ad hoc, then a Checklist Template is a great solution.

You start by defining the steps (tasks) that need to be followed. Each task can have a simple check or even a question that needs to be answered (e.g. text, number, URL, email, date). Use our simple Template editor to create your template:

![Checklist Template Editor](/assets/images/templates/template-editor.png){: .image-medium}

Once you have a template, you (or authorized member of your team) can easily trigger it from the Dashboard) and assign it to the team or specific user to follow. See below about scheduling templates. The assigned user then needs to go through the checklist marking it as they progress. We call this: “playing” the list. Progress can be tracked by management.

Here’s what playing the list looks like:

Example Use cases: [Employee onboarding ↗](https://checklist.com/employee-onboarding-checklist "Employee onboarding Checklist"){:target="\_blank"}, [Office Cleaning ↗](https://checklist.com/office-cleaning-checklist "Office Cleaning Checklist"){:target="\_blank"}, [SEO ↗](https://checklist.com/seo-checklist "SEO Checklist"){:target="\_blank"}, [Vehicle Inspection ↗](https://checklist.com/vehicle-inspection-checklist "Vehicle Insepection Checklist"){:target="\_blank"}

Read more on [Checklist Templates](/templates/templates) or get started by customizing our [Store Opening & Closing Checklist ↗](https://checklist.com/retail-store-opening-closing-checklist){:target="\_blank"} template (click on the Save as Template button to save it as your own template and then play around with it). Don't forget to Trigger it so that you can play it (i.e. follow the steps).

## Scheduled Template

Your checklist templates can be automatically scheduled to be "triggered" (i.e. create a checklist from them) on a regular basis:

![Checklist Template Schedule](/assets/images/start/start-template-schedule.png){: .image-medium}

Example Use cases: store opening, store closing, restaurant health inspection, fire inspection, security audit

Read more about [Checklist Automation ↗](/automation/){ :target="\_blank"} and specifically how to [add a scedule to a template ↗](/automation/#template-automation){: target="\_blank"}.

To try out a schedule template, create one (following the instructions above) and then click the "Automation" button followed by "Add Schedule".

## Form2Task

"Form To Task" is a great way to collect responses from your customers and have them automatically turned into tasks for further handling by your team. We have a simple yet powerful Online Form Builder letting you define the online form. For example:

![Voluteer Signup Online Form](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-form.png){: .image-medium}

You can then share the form with your customers (email, QR Code on embed on your site), and they can fill it out. Responses are automatically added to your checklist as a task row in the table:

![Checklist form responses in a table](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-table.png)

You can then manage the responses: prioritize then, assign to team members, add notes, attachments, etc. Or export them.

Example Use cases: [contact us ↗](https://checklist.com/forms/contact){:target="\_blank"}, [volunteer signup ↗](https://checklist.com/forms/volunteer-signup){:target="\_blank"}, [customer feedback ↗](https://checklist.com/forms/customer-feedback){:target="\_blank"}, [event registration ↗](https://checklist.com/forms/event-registration){:target="\_blank"}, lead generation
