# Get Started with Checklist


To begin, you need to create a free Checklist account. Simply visit [My Account](https://checklist.com/account){:target="_blank"}, and sign in (create an account or log in if you haven't already). Return here once you've completed this step.

For the next phase, let's identify your objectives. We've categorized different options to suit various use cases. Choose your scenario to learn more:
# A One-Time project
Ideal for a standalone list related to a single project (could be ongoing). Tasks can be pre-known or added as needed:

- [List View](#list-view) - a simple list with tasks to check off
- [Table View](#table-view) - a checklist in table format, with each task (row) having additional fields (columns)

# A Repetitive Business Process
Checklists are a great tool for managing repetitive business processes:

- [Checklist Template](#checklist-template) - a repetitive process that needs to be handled on-demand by me or one of my team members
- [Scheduled Template](#scheduled-template) - a repeptive process that needs to be handled on a regular schedule by me or one of my team members
- [Form2Task](#form2task) - collect responses from my customers and have them automatically turned into tasks for further handling by my team

Not sure which fits your case? Read below for more details.

## List View

A checklist with tasks to check off:

![Checklist in list view](/assets/images/start/start-checklist-view.png){: .image-large}

Starts simple but is very powerful! This view also offers: subtasks, notes, attachments, due dates, reminders, sharing, assigning and more.

## Table View

This view displays your checklist in a table format:

Task can have different fields (in columns) such as notes, assignees, attachments, emails, URLs, etc. You have complete control over the fields you want to add to your table.

## Checklist Template

## Scheduled Template

## Form2Task

"Form To Task" is a great way to collect responses from your customers and have them automatically turned into tasks for further handling by your team. We have a simple yet powerful Online Form Builder letting you define the online form. For example:

![](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-form.png){: .image-medium}

You can then share the form with your customers (email, QR Code on embed on your site), and they can fill it out.  Responses are automatically added to your checklist as a task row in the table:

![](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-table.png)

You can then manage the responses: prioritize then, assign to team members, add notes, attachments, etc. Or export them.
