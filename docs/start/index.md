# Get Started with Checklist

To begin, you need to create a free Checklist account. Simply visit https://checklist.com/account, and sign in (create an account or log in if you haven't already). Return here once you've completed this step.

For the next phase, let's identify your objectives. We've categorized different options to suit various use cases. Choose your scenario to learn more:

# A One-Time project
Ideal for a standalone list related to a single project (could be ongoing). Tasks can be pre-known or added as needed.
* List View: I want a simple list with tasks to check off.

* Table View: I need a checklist where each task can have multiple fields (such as notes, assignees, attachments, emails, URLs, etc.)

# A repetitive process
Checklists are a great tool for working with repetitive business processes. 
* Checklist Template: I have a business process that needs to be handled on-demand by me or one of my team members
* Scheduled Template: I have a business process that needs to be repeated on schedule
* Form2Task: I need to manage information collected through an online form

Each response from the form:

Turns into a row in the table:

You can then manage responses as tasks, assign them to team members, add notes, attachments, etc.
