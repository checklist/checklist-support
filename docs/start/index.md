# Get Started with Checklist

To begin, you need to create a free Checklist account. Simply visit [My Account](https://checklist.com/account){:target="_blank"}, and sign in (create an account or log in if you haven't already). Return here once you've completed this step.

For the next phase, let's identify your objectives. We've categorized different options to suit various use cases. Choose your scenario to learn more:

# A One-Time project

Ideal for a standalone list related to a single project (could be ongoing). Tasks can be pre-known or added as needed:

- [List View](#list-view) - a simple list with tasks to check off
- [Table View](#table-view) - a checklist in table format, with each task (row) having additional fields (columns)

# A Repetitive Business Process

Checklists are a great tool for managing repetitive business processes:

- [Checklist Template](#checklist-template) - a repetitive process that needs to be handled on-demand by me or one of my team members
- [Scheduled Template](#scheduled-template) - a repeptive process that needs to be handled on a regular schedule by me or one of my team members
- [Form2Task](#form2task) - collect responses from my customers and have them automatically turned into tasks for further handling by my team

Not sure which fits your case? Read below for more details.

## List View

A checklist with tasks to check off:

![Checklist in list view](/assets/images/start/start-checklist-view.png){: .image-large}

Starts simple but is very powerful! This view also offers: subtasks, notes, attachments, due dates, reminders, sharing, assigning and more.

Use cases: [House moving](https://checklist.com/moving){:target="_blank"}, [Business statup](https://checklist.com/business-startup-checklist){:target="_blank"}, [Daily to do](https://checklist.com/daily-to-do-list){:target="_blank"}, [Event](https://checklist.com/event){:target="_blank"}, [Cleaning](https://checklist.com/cleaning){:target="_blank"}

## Table View

This view displays your checklist in a table format:

![Checklist in table view](/assets/images/start/start-table-view.png)

Task can have different fields (in columns) such as notes, assignees, attachments, emails, URLs, etc. You have complete control over the fields you want to add to your table.

Use cases: Project Task Tracking and Assigning, Inventory management, Product development, CRM (lead management)

## Checklist Template

If you have a business process (i.e a set of defined tasks) that needs to be repeated on schedule or ad hoc, then a Checklist Template is a great solution.

You start by defining the steps (tasks) that need to be followed. Each task can have a simple check or even a question that needs to be answered (e.g. text, number, URL, email, date). Use our simple Template editor to create your template:

![Checklist Template Editor](/assets/images/templates/template-editor.png)

Once you have a template, you (or authorized member of your team) can easily trigger it from the Dashboard) and assign it to the team or specific user to follow. See below about scheduling templates. The assigned user then needs to go through the checklist marking it as they progress. We call this: “playing” the list. Progress can be tracked by management.

Here’s what playing the list looks like:

Use cases: [Employee onboarding](https://checklist.com/employee-onboarding-checklist){:target="_blank"}, [Office Cleaning](https://checklist.com/office-cleaning-checklist){:target="_blank"}, [SEO](https://checklist.com/seo-checklist){:target="_blank"}

## Scheduled Template

Your checklist templates can be automatically scheduled to be "triggered" (i.e. create a checklist from them) on a regular basis:

![Checklist Template Schedule](/assets/images/start/start-template-schedule.png){: .image-medium}

Use cases: store opening, store closing, restaurant health inspection, fire inspection, security audit

## Form2Task

"Form To Task" is a great way to collect responses from your customers and have them automatically turned into tasks for further handling by your team. We have a simple yet powerful Online Form Builder letting you define the online form. For example:

![Voluteer Signup Online Form](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-form.png){: .image-medium}

You can then share the form with your customers (email, QR Code on embed on your site), and they can fill it out. Responses are automatically added to your checklist as a task row in the table:

![Checklist form responses in a table](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-table.png)

You can then manage the responses: prioritize then, assign to team members, add notes, attachments, etc. Or export them.

Use cases: [contact us](https://checklist.com/forms/contact){:target="_blank"}, [volunteer signup](https://checklist.com/forms/volunteer-signup){:target="_blank"}, [customer feedback](https://checklist.com/forms/customer-feedback){:target="_blank"}, [event registration](https://checklist.com/forms/event-registration){:target="_blank"}, lead generation
