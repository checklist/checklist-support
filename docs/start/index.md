# Get Started with Checklist


To begin, you need to create a free Checklist account. Simply visit [My Account](https://checklist.com/account){:target="\_blank"}, and sign in (create an account or log in if you haven't already). Return here once you've completed this step.

For the next phase, let's identify your objectives. We've categorized different options to suit various use cases. Choose your scenario to learn more:
# A One-Time project
Ideal for a standalone list related to a single project (could be ongoing). Tasks can be pre-known or added as needed:

- [List View](#list-view) - a simple list with tasks to check off
- [Table View](#table-view) - a checklist in table format, with each task (row) having additional fields (columns)

# A repetitive process
Checklists are a great tool for managing repetitive business processes:

- [Checklist Template](#checklist-template) - a repetitive process that needs to be handled on-demand by me or one of my team members
- [Scheduled Template](#scheduled-template) - a repeptive process that needs to be handled on a regular schedule by me or one of my team members
- [Form2Task](#form2task) - collect responses from my customers and have them automatically turned into tasks for further handling by my team

Not sure which fits your case? Read below for more details.

## List View

A checklist with tasks to check off:

![Checklist in list view](/assets/images/start/start-checklist-view.png){: .image-large}

Starts simple but is very powerful! This view also offers: subtasks, notes, attachments, due dates, reminders, sharing, assigning and more.

## Table View

This view displays your checklist in a table format. Task can have different fields (in columns) such as notes, assignees, attachments, emails, URLs, etc.

## Checklist Template

## Scheduled Template

## Form2Task

Each response from the form:

![](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-form.png)

Turns into a row in the table:

![](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-table.png)

You can then manage responses as tasks, assign them to team members, add notes, attachments, etc.
