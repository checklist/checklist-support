# Template Run
The true power of Checklist is in its ability to re-use previously created checklist templates over and over. Don't re-invent the wheel!

"Running" a template creates a checklist which you (or anyone you assign it to) can use. It is mostly used in a business environment where you want to follow a particular business process. For example store opening checklist or [hotel cleaning checklist](https://checklist.com/hotel-cleaning-checklist). But you can also use it in a personal setting such as a [Travel Packing Checklist](https://checklist.com/travel-checklist). Visit our [checklist templates](https://checklist.com/templates) to see more examples.

To Run a template:
* your or a team member must create the template
* the template must be marked a star (Favorite)
* you must have the Runner team role

You can then visit the [Checklist Dashboard](/mobile/dashboard) and see a list of the available templates you can run. Click on the Run button (the running man) to open the Template Run dialog:
