# Template Run
The true power of Checklist is in its ability to re-use previously created checklist templates over and over. Don't re-invent the wheel!

"Running" a template creates a checklist which you (or anyone you assign it to) can use. It is mostly used in a business environment where you want to follow a particular business process. For example store opening checklist or [cleaning checklist](https://checklist.com/cleaning-checklist){:target="\_blank"}. But you can also use it in a personal setting such as a [Travel Packing Checklist](https://checklist.com/travel-checklist){:target="\_blank"}. Visit our [checklist templates](https://checklist.com/templates){:target="\_blank"} to see more examples.

To Run a template:
* your or a team member must create the template
* the template must be marked a star (Favorite)
* you must have the Runner team role

You can then visit the [Checklist Dashboard](/mobile/dashboard) and see a list of the available templates you can run. Click on the Run button (the running man) to open the Template Run dialog:

## Checklist Name
To give the new checklist a name, the app will automatically add the current date and time to the name of the template. You can change it if you like.

## Assignees
The checklist is assigned to the entire team by default. You can change that by checking or unchecking the different members.

## Notes
If the template has notes, those will be automatically inserted. Make any changes or additions you like. The created checklist will have those notes.

## Run
Click on the Run button and the app will create the checklist. The created checklist will show up for any assigned member.
