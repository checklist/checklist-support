# The Task

Tasks are the main building blocks of a Checklist. Read more about [tasks in Checklist](/checklists/task-types/).


The following actions are available:

## Status
You can control the status of a task using its checkbox: check (completed) and uncheck (open). Note that once a task and all its siblings (i.e. on the same level) are completed, it parent task is also marked as completed. This goes up all the way to the checklist. If any subtask is open, then its parent task must also be open. Changing the status of a task will make all its children have the same status.

## Name
Click on the task name to start editing it. Hit 'done' to save. Note that it is not possible to have "new lines" in task names. This allows for easy editing. If you want text with paragraphs, enter it in the task notes.

## Swipe

You can swipe tasks left or right to reveal more actions:

To clarify what we mean by swipe directions:
| Name | Swipe direction | 
|:-----|:----------------|
|Right | swipe from left TO right |
|Left  | swipe from right TO left |

### Delete task
To delete a task, left swipe it and click on the red Trash button. The task (and any of its subtasks) is immediately deleted.

### Subtask
To make a task into a subtask of the task above it, right swipe it and click on the > (subtask) button. The subtask will be indented to the right.

## UnSubtask
To reverse a subtask action, left swipe the task and click on the < (unsubtask) button.

### Zoom
Swipe the task right and click on the Zoom button (Green magnifying glass) to view the task and any subtasks it may have. You can then add more subtasks. You can further zoom or simple zoom out by swiping right again on the zoomed task and clicking on the unzoom button:

## Task Menu
Additional actions can be perfomed by clicking on the task menu button. That is the button with 3 horizontal (on ios) or vertical (on Android) dots. This will open the task menu. The actual options available depends on the checklist type and your permissions:
