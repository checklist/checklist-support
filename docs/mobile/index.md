# Welcome to Checklist

{: .no_toc }

At the core of Checklist is, of course, the checklist: a list of tasks (with optional sub-tasks). Each task has a name and status (open/complete). You can also add additional fields like due date, notes, assignee, or anything else you wish.

Have you heard the phrase: "don't reinvent the checklist"? In most cases, someone else has already thought of the checklist you are about to start. So give yourself a head start: use our database of thousands of checklist templates to kickstart your next checklist.
