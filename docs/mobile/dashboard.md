# Mobile Dashboard

The Dashboard allows you to see your checklists from a bird's eye view. It surfaces all the important information and let's you run templates.

To view the Dashboard, open the app drawer (swipe the screen from left to right or click on the > arrow on the top left) and click on the first button (top left). The Dashboard will be shown:

The following widgets are available (more are being added):

## Run Templates
Templates can be "run" to create repeatable checklists from them. Click on a template Run icon to open the [Run Template dialog](/mobile/templates/run).

Note: to view the Run Template Widget you must have the Runner role. Templates that are marked as Favorite (star) will be shown.

## Today's Checklists
Any checklists created today will be shown here.

## Yesterday's Checklists
Any checklists created yesterday will be shown here.

## Due & Expired
