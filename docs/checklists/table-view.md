## Columns
The biggest different between Checklist and Table views are "Columns". Columns allow you to add an unlimited number of "fields" (columns) to each task. This means that each task can include more data.

By default, the following fields are created for each checklist:
* Assign
* Due Date
* Attachments
* Priority

Depending on your plan, you can add more fields or edit existing ones.

### Managing Columns
To manage your checklist columns, click on the Columns button:

* name - the name of the columns
* edit button - use it to make changes to the column
