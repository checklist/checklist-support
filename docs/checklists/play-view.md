The "Play View" is similar to the "Form View" but users are given one task at a time in a "focused mode". Rather than showing the full checklist, each task is shown on a full screen dialog and the user can answer the question and move to the next task. Here is an example of a checklist in Play View:

![](/assets/images/views/play-view.gif){: .image-medium}

In all other respects, the "Play View" is similar to the [Form View](/checklists/form-view/).
