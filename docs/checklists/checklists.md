## Creating Checklists

To create a new checklist, go to the Checklists page and click the "New Checklist" button:

![Create Checklist](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-add.png)

This will open the "Create a Checklist" dialog:

![Create Checklist Dialog](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-add-dialog.png)

Once you click in the checklist name field, the app will display a list of types to choose from:

![Create Checklist Choose Type](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-add-type.png)

You can choose from any available types. Alternatively, start typing the name of the type you want to create. If there's a checklist template with a similar name, we'll suggest it:

![Create Checklist Matching Templates](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-add-templates.png)

You have two options:
* Preview - click to see the template before using it.
* Use - click to create a checklist from this template.

If you don't want to use any of the suggested templates, continue typing the name of the checklist type you want to create. 

Note: The checklist name must be 1-256 characters long.

You can then choose from the following default view options:
* List - a simple checklist with tasks and subtasks.
* Table - a checklist with a table view.

To learn more about the different views, refer to [Checklist Views](/checklists/checklist-views/).

Click the "Create" button to create the checklist.

Once created, the app will redirect to the new checklist.

### Create a Checklist from a Template

## The Checklist Page

A newly created checklist opens with the Checklist view and is devoid of tasks:

![Empty Checklist](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-new.png)

![Checklist Name](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-page-name.png)

Click on the checklist name to edit it:

![Edit Checklist Name](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-page-name-edit.png)

Make the desired changes to the name and either hit Enter or click anywhere outside the name. Cancel changes with the ESC button.

## Checklist Status

The Checklist status can be open or completed (unchecked or checked, respectively):

![Checklist Status](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-page-status.png)

The status auto-updates based on the checklist's task statuses. Read more about [Checklist Propagation](/checklists/form-view/#propagation).

To manually change the status, click on the checkbox:

![Checklist Menu](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-page-menu.png)

## Move Completed Tasks to End

Boost productivity by moving completed tasks to the end. Open the Checklist menu and check the checkbox next to "Move Completed to End."

When checked, completed tasks are moved to the end but as individual tasks, not subtasks. This ensures completed tasks are kept at the end of the checklist, not just as the last subtask.

## Delete Completed Tasks

Open the Checklist menu and click "Delete Completed Tasks" to remove completed tasks.

## Duplicate Checklist

Duplicate a checklist by clicking "Duplicate Checklist" in the Checklist menu. This opens the "Duplicate Checklist" dialog:

![Duplicate Checklist](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-duplicate.png)

Provide a new name, hit Duplicate, and navigate to the new checklist.

Note: Attachments are not duplicated for privacy reasons.

## Make Checklist into a Template

If you regularly use a checklist, make it a template. From the Checklist Menu, click "Make into a template." A confirmation dialog opens:

![Checklist to Template Dialog](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-make-template-dialog.png)

Click Confirm, and the app processes the request, displaying a confirmation message:

![Checklist Template Created](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-make-template-confirmed.png)

Click EDIT on the message to edit the template immediately.

Read more about [Checklist Templates](/templates/templates/).

## Publish Checklist

Publish the checklist on checklist.com for others to view/use. Open the Checklist Menu and click "Publish Checklist." This opens the "Publish Checklist" dialog:

![Checklist Publish Dialog](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-publish-dialog.png)

Click the button to get a private link (accessible only by people with the private link). The dialog displays the link to your checklist:

![Checklist Published Dialog](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-published-dialog.png)

Click the link to view the published checklist or use the 'Link' button to copy it. Unpublish to revoke access.

See below how to add [notes](#checklist-notes) to the published checklist.

Warning: Unpublishing and then re-publishing generates a new link, rendering the old link inaccessible.

## Embed Your Checklist

You can [Publish a Checklist](#publish-checklist) and then embed it on your site. On the published checklist, click on the Embed button:

![Published Checklist](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-published.png)

Copy the embed code and paste it on your website HTML code:

![Checklist Embed](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-embed.png)
