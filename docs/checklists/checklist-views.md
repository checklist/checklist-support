A checklist follows the "tree" structure in which it can have tasks and subtask and sub-subtasks. One of the core features of Checklist is the possibility to view your checklists using different "Views". Those can be tailoed to fit your particular use case. 

You can easily switch between different views using the View Selector. Bear in mind that some views do not show the full checklist data. E.g. unlike the Table View, the Checklist View (the simplest one) does not show the additional column fields.

Each task (and the checklist itself) has:
* status (open/ completed - unchecked/ checked)
* name
* notes
* additional and optional fields 
* meta - describing the fields

Below is the list of currently available Views. We are working on additional views, so please [let us know](https://checklist.com/feedback){:target="_blank"} if you wish to have any other ones.
