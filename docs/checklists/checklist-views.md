# Checklist Views

{: .no_toc }

</details>

A checklist follows a "tree" structure with tasks, subtasks, and sub-subtasks. One of the core features of Checklist is the ability to view checklists using different "Views" tailored to your specific use case.

Switching between views is easy using the View Selector. Keep in mind that some views may not display the full checklist data; for example, the Checklist View (the simplest one) does not show additional column fields like the Table View.

Each task (and the checklist itself) includes:

- Status (open/completed - unchecked/checked)
- Name
- Notes
- Additional and optional fields
- Meta description of the fields

Below is a list of currently available Views. We are actively working on additional views, so please [let us know â†—](https://checklist.com/feedback){:target="\_blank"} if you have any other preferences.

## Switching Views

At the top of the Checklist Page is the View Selector:

![Checklist page view selector](/assets/images/checklists/checklist-page-view-selector.png)

Clicking on it will open the following menu:

![Checklist page view menu selector](/assets/images/checklists/checklists-view-selector-open.png)

You can:

- Click on the TEXT of the view name (Checklist, Table, or Form) to switch to that view.
- Check a view to add it to the available views (for non-owners).
- Uncheck a view to remove it from available views.
- Click on the radio option to choose the default view (to be loaded by default). Note that you cannot select an option if it has not been enabled.
- Click again on the selector or anywhere outside to close the menu.

Note: The View Selector is for Checklist Owners and is not available to other users. They will get the default view.

### Checklist View

The Checklist View is the simplest yet powerful, providing a To-Do-like perspective of your checklist:

### Table View

The Table view allows you to add additional columns to your checklist and display them in a table format. You can add, remove, hide, and customize the type of columns per checklist:

### Form View

The Form View is used together with a checklist template, enabling you to create a set of questions for checklist completion. Questions can range from simple checkmarks to answering text questions, setting a date, or uploading a file.

### Play View

The Form view is used together with a checklist, creating a set of questions to complete the checklist. It is similar to the Form View (see above), but in Play view, the user is in Focus mode (i.e., no surrounding interface), and each task is shown one at a time.
