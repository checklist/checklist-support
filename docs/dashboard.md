# Dashboard

The Dashboard is designed to provide you with an overview of your checklists, emphasizing what's important. It can be personalized to suit your needs.

By default, upon login, you are directed to the Checklists page. If you prefer the Dashboard as your default page, you can adjust this setting in the Account Preferences page.

Here's a snapshot of a typical Dashboard:
