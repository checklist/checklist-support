## Organizations
An organization is the top level unit for Checklist. When you create a new account, we will also create for you an organization (and a team in it). This organization can be used by you alone or with a more people as part of a team(s). 

Although Checklist is free, you may decide to upgrade your account to make use of more enterprise features. In that case, we use the Organization as the billing entity for the subscription. We also calculate the allowed quotas and usage based on the Organization.

An organization can have 1 or more teams in it. For example, you can have a marketing team or a sales team. See [teams](/teams) for more

## Viewing the Organization
To view your organization, click on the Teams button on the main navigation of the app (on the left of the screen):

Once selected, you will see in the blue section a list of any organizations or teams you belong to. Click on the organization you wish to view to show it in the main section of the screen.
