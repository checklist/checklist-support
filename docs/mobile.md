At the core of Checklist is of course the checklist: a list of tasks (with optional sub tasks). Each task has a name and status (open/ complete). You can also add addtional fields like due date, notes, assignee or anything else you wish.

Have you heard the phrase: "don't re-invent the checklist"? In most cases, someone else has already thought of the checklist you are about to start. So give yourself a headstart: use our database of thousands of checklist templates to kickstart your next checklist.

Open the menu on the top right for Help with the Checklist app.
