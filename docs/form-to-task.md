## Overview

Form To Task (Form2Task) is a feature within Checklist designed to streamline the process of collecting and managing information. It allows users to create online forms linked to their checklists, with responses automatically converted into tasks. This feature is particularly beneficial for businesses or organizations that require structured data input through forms.

Form To Task is tailored for [Checklist Pro 竊余(https://checklist.com/pricing "Checklist Pricing"){:target="\_blank"} users seeking an efficient way to collect responses from individuals or teams. It enhances collaboration and data organization for various purposes, such as:

- Collecting customer feedback.
- Managing job applications.
- Conducting surveys or polls.
- Gathering event registrations.
- Handling service requests.
- And more...

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Checklist

[Create a checklist 竊余(/checklists/checklists/#creating-checklists){:target="\_blank"} and select "Table" view during creation.

### 2. Configure a Form

On the checklist (in Table view), click the Form button:

This opens the Form Configuration dialog:

![Forms Configuration Dialog](/assets/images/form-to-task/forms-configuration-dialog.png)

Configure the form by choosing fields, adding intro text or a description, and deciding if the form is editable by responders. Save when ready.

### 3. Share the Form

Utilize the generated link, QR code, or embed code to share the form with customers, leads, or users.

### 4. Collecting Responses

Examples like [Contact us 竊余(https://checklist.com/forms/contact "Online Contact Us Form builder"){:target="\_blank"} or [Volunteer Signup 竊余(https://checklist.com/forms/volunteer-signup "Online Volunteer Signup Form builder"){:target="\_blank} illustrate the process:

![Volunteer Signup Online Form](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-form.png){: .image-medium}

Visitors answer questions, and upon submission, results are recorded as tasks in the checklist.

### 5. Working with Submissions

Recorded submissions appear as tasks in the checklist, visible in both Table and List views:

Additional columns can be added for task processing (due dates, priority, assignment, etc.).

Tasks (responses) can be assigned to team members for further processing.

### 6. Editing Submissions

If enabled in the form configuration, responders can make subsequent modifications to their submissions, immediately reflected in the checklist task:
