## How It Works

Let's dive in by seeing how it works:

### 1. Create a Checklist

[Create a checklist 竊余(/checklists/checklists/#creating-checklists){:target="\_blank"} and choose "Table" view when creating it.

### 2. Configure a Form

On the checklist (in Table view), click on the Form button:

![Form Button](/assets/images/form-to-task/forms-button.png)

to access the Form Configuration dialog:

![Forms Configuration Dialog](/assets/images/form-to-task/forms-configuration-dialog.png)

You can then configure the form to your needs:
- Select which fields to include in the form.
- Add an intro text or a description to the form.
- Make the form editable by responders (they get a link they can revisit to keep it up to date).

Save the form when ready.

### 3. Share the Form

Use the generated link, QR code, or embed code to share the form with customers, leads, or users. 

### 4. Collecting Responses

You can see our [Contact us 竊余(https://checklist.com/forms/contact "Online Contact Us Form builder"){:target="\_blank"} or [Volunteer Signup 竊余(https://checklist.com/forms/volunteer-signup "Online Volunteer Signup Form buiilder"){:target="\_blank} forms as examples:

![Volunteer Signup Online Form](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-form.png){: .image-medium}

When someone visits the form, they answer questions, and upon submission, results are recorded as tasks in the checklist.

### 5. Working with Submissions

Recorded submissions appear as tasks in the checklist, visible in both Table and List views:

![Checklist form responses in a table](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-table.png)

Additional columns can be added to manage task processing (due dates, priority, assignment etc.).

You can assign tasks (responses) to team members for further processing. 

### 6. Editing Submissions

If enabled in the form configuration, responders can make subsequent modifications to their submissions. Changes are immediately reflected in the checklist task:
