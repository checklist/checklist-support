## Overview

Form To Task (Form2Task) is a feature within Checklist designed to streamline the process of collecting and managing information. It allows users to create online forms linked to their checklists, with responses automatically converted into tasks. This feature is particularly beneficial for businesses or organizations that require structured data input through forms.

Form To Task is tailored for [Checklist Pro ↗](https://checklist.com/pricing "Checklist Pricing"){:target="\_blank"} users seeking an efficient way to collect responses from individuals or teams. It enhances collaboration and data organization for various purposes, such as:

- Collecting customer feedback.
- Managing job applications.
- Conducting surveys or polls.
- Gathering event registrations.
- Handling service requests.
- And more...

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Checklist

[Create a checklist ↗](/checklists/checklists/#creating-checklists){:target="\_blank"} and select "Table" view during creation.

### 2. Configure a Form

On the checklist (in Table view), click the Form button:

This opens the Form Configuration dialog:

![Forms Configuration Dialog](/assets/images/form-to-task/forms-configuration-dialog.png)

Configure the form by choosing fields, adding intro text or a description, and deciding if the form is editable by responders. Save when ready.

### 3. Share the Form

Utilize the generated link, QR code, or embed code to share the form with customers, leads, or users.

### 4. Collecting Responses

Examples like [Contact us ↗](https://checklist.com/forms/contact "Online Contact Us Form builder"){:target="\_blank"} or [Volunteer Signup ↗](https://checklist.com/forms/volunteer-signup "Online Volunteer Signup Form builder"){:target="\_blank} illustrate the process:

![Volunteer Signup Online Form](/assets/images/start/form-2-task-form.png){: .image-medium}

Visitors answer questions, and upon submission, results are recorded as tasks in the checklist.

### 5. Working with Submissions

Recorded submissions appear as tasks in the checklist, visible in both Table and List views:

Additional columns can be added for task processing (due dates, priority, assignment, etc.).

Tasks (responses) can be assigned to team members for further processing.

### 6. Editing Submissions

If enabled in the form configuration, responders can make subsequent modifications to their submissions, immediately reflected in the checklist task:

## Working with Submissions

Each recorded submission is automatically added to the checklist as a task. Users can conveniently view these tasks in both Table (preferred) and List views of the checklist. Columns will include each of the answers given to the questions. 

In addition to form-related fields, you can add columns to facilitate task processing. These columns are not visible to the responders and remain private to the checklist users. 

For instance, include a Priority column (high/medium/low) to determine the urgency of processing. Alternatively, an Assignee field can be added to distribute tasks among team members. Feel free to customize and manage additional fields as needed, providing flexibility for effective task management within your team.

## Team Work

When collaborating in a team, it is convenient to assign each response to a specific team member for processing. 

The checklist owner can further enhance team coordination by setting the [Permissions level of the checklist to "Assign" ↗](/checklists/checklist-members/#assign){:target="\_blank}. With this setting, team members who are not owners will only have visibility and updating capabilities for tasks assigned to them. This ensures a streamlined and organized workflow within the team.
