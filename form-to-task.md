## What is the Feature

Form To Task (Form2Task) is a Chekclist feature that enables users to create online forms linked to their checklists. Responses submitted through these forms are automatically added as tasks in the associated checklist. This feature offers a seamless way to collect, process and manage information.

You can then configure the form to your needs:
- Select which fields to include in the form.
- Add an intro text or a description to the form.
- Make the form editable by responders (they can revisit it to keep it up to date).

Save the form when ready.

### 3. Share the Form

### 5. Working with Submissions

Recorded submissions appear as tasks in the checklist, visible in both Table and List views.

Additional columns can be added to manage task processing (due dates, priority, assignment etc.).

You can assign tasks (responses) to team members for further processing. 

### 7. Editing Submissions

If enabled in the form configuration, responders can make subsequent modifications to their submissions. Changes are immediately reflected in the checklist task:
